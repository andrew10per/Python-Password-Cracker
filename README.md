# Python-Password-Cracker
Uses brute force and dictionary methods to crack passwords on .zip files that are protected. Passwords are passed through using utf-8 encoding.

All example files (brute_force.zip, dictionary_attack.zip, and short_dict.txt) were provided by Canisius College Cumputer Science dept.

Python file contains functions to run a brute force attack, run a dicitonary attakc, open a dictionary file (a text file with each password on  a new line), open a .zip folder,
and also a main function which runs the command line. The main function also adds the ability to run a dictionary attack, and if that fails, then resort to a brute force attack.

brute_force.zip is an example of a protected .zip that the brute force method can break into, and dictionary_attack.zip is an example of one that can be cracked using 
short_dict.txt
